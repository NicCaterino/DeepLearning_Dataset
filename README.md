Dataset used for DeepLearning exams.
Two distinct datasets were employed, to represent diverse real-world scenarios and ensure the model's robustness across different text genres and topics. The variation in text sizes within each dataset further challenges the model to generalize its compression capabilities across a range of input lengths. Both Dataset contain .txt files ranging from 1kb to 5kb dimension. 

-BBC Articles Dataset comprises approximately 2000 text samples extracted from articles published by the BBC covering various topics such as sports, business, and technology
-School Books Dataset, comprises approximately 3000 text samples in TXT format, with sizes ranging from 1KB to 5KB.These texts are sourced from 11th and 12th-grade school books used in the US.
